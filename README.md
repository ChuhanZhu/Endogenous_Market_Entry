# Endogenous Market Entry of Financial Intermediaries

This repository contains MATLAB code and simulation results for a project studying how financial intermediaries with heterogeneous productivity types make **sequential entry decisions** into the market.  

## Project Overview
- Models the sequential entry and type choice of intermediaries under heterogeneous productivity.  
- Entry cost is modeled as **independent of productivity**, isolating the role of heterogeneity in shaping market outcomes.  
- Simulation results reproduce empirical findings: in existing markets, **shadow banks** exhibit higher and more dispersed productivity distributions compared to traditional intermediaries.  

## Tools and Methods
- MATLAB implementation of optimization problems for sequential entry.  
- Algorithms to simulate productivity type distributions across entrants.  
- Calibration and validation against empirical market patterns.  

## Repository Contents
- `code/`: MATLAB scripts for solving the sequential entry model and running simulations.  
- `results/`: Output figures and tables showing simulated productivity distributions.
